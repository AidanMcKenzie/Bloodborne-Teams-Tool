# Bloodborne Teams Tool

## Background
FromSoftware's action role-playing video game Bloodborne, released on the PlayStation 4 in 2015, supports multiplayer with up to 3 players in one session. However, there is no easy or intuitive way within the game to have a concurrent playthrough of the entire game with seven players.

## Purpose
This tool/web app is used alongside a playthrough of Bloodborne in order to automatically assign each of the seven players to one of two teams. The intention is that this tool provides a seemingly random assignment of the players, which will provide numerous different combinations across both teams, such that team combinations are always fresh and are usually not repeated, so that the playthrough of the game is more enjoyable and varied. Ideally, this tool would be used to randomly generate a new team for each area within the game.

## Features
The tool contains the following features:	
•	Assign all seven players’ characters to one of two teams (Team A and Team B)
•	Clicking the 'Generate Teams' button provides the user with a new team which is sufficiently different from the last
•	Displays the names of the Bloodborne characters that have been created by the players
•	Displays the names of the players alongside their character’s name
•	Display images taken from the game of the players’ characters alongside the character name
•	The visual design of the tool resembles that of the game

## Technologies
This tool is built using Angular, and is a simple single-page web app.
